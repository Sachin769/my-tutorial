Plugins

In fastify, a plugin is a way to extend functionlity in the fastify instance/object on the basis of application requirement.
Like--> 1.Add new routes/endpoints
        2.Add Middleware
        3.Decorate(extend more key) this way we can add more function or key in fastify object to easily access.
